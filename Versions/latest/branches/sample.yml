#This defines your branch.
branch:
  # This is the name of the item that will be shown to players in the gui.
  # This variable supports chat color in combination with the '&' character.
  name: '&7&lSample'

  # This is the material of the item that represents this branch in the gui.
  # It must be a valid material from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
  # This value is case insensitive.
  representing-material: 'diamond_block'

  # Specify the list of up to 5 branches that follow this branch
  # (The last rank of this branch proceeds into the first ranks of the branches in this list)
  # If this list is empty, players can't rank up any further when they reach the last rank in this branch.
  # The values in the list have to be filenames of yml files in the branches folder that contain
  # a branch configuration of the desired branch.
  child-branches: [another-sample.yml, child-branch-sample.yml]

  # Specify at least 1 rank that belongs to this branch.
  ranks:
    # This unique identifier corresponds to the name of the corresponding rank in your permissions manager.
    # It is also the name of the rank you have to use to rank up a player using the /blockyranks set ... command.
    # Make sure your whole branch tree only has one rank identified by this key!
    example:

      # This is the name of the rank as it is displayed to the players in the gui.
      # This variable supports chat color in combination with the '&' character.
      display-name: '&6Example'

      # This is the material of the item that represents this rank in the gui.
      # It must be a valid material from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
      # This value is case insensitive.

      # This amount of money has to be paid to rank up to this rank.
      # set to 0 to ignore this price.
      money-cost: 10.0

      # This amount of levels of xp has to be paid to rank up to this rank.
      # set to 0 to ignore this price.
      xp-cost: 3

      # To rank up to this rank, the player has to have played this amount of time in seconds.
      # The value supports short-hand notation:
      #     y... years (really? like... really?)
      #     w... weeks
      #     d... days
      #     h... hours
      #     m... minutes
      #     s... seconds
      #     for example, 1d6h2m40s would equal to 1 day, 6 hours, 2 minutes and 40seconds. 600s would equal to 600 seconds or 10 minutes.
      #     (just entering a number is fine as well, they are interpreted in seconds. e.g. 604800 is equal to 7d (7 days))
      # set to 0 to ignore this requirement.
      # (this is no payment, just a requirement)
      play-time: 1m

      # To rank up to this rank, the player has to have to have acquired this amount of McMMO skill-levels.
      # set to 0 to ignore this requirement.
      # (this is no payment, just a requirement)
      mcmmo-levels: 1

      # These are the perks the players get when they rank up to this rank.
      # (They are purely esthetic and shown in the gui - the actual implementation has
      # to be done using your permissions plugin of choice!)
      # The values support chat color in combination with the '&' character.

      # These commands will be run upon ranking up to the rank.
      # You can specify as many as you like and they will be run in order.
      # The command sender will be the console so it will behave as if you type the
      # command into the console manually. No checks are performed on the validity
      # of the command! If you don't want to run any commands just remove this key or
      # set it to []. The commands support the placeholders {player}, {nickname} and {rank}.
